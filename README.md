A Simple Black and White Minimalist Blog Template
This is the source code repository for a blog tempalte. The blog is built using Next.js 13.4.4 and styled with Tailwind CSS.

Features
Next.js: The blog is built using Next.js, a React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation. Next.js provides a fast and efficient development experience with excellent performance.
Tailwind CSS: The styling of the blog is done using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. Tailwind CSS allows for rapid prototyping and easy customization, enabling me to create a visually appealing and responsive design.

Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone [repository URL]
Navigate to the project directory: cd my-portfolio-blog

Usage
To run the blog locally, use the following command:

This will start a local development server and provide you with a URL to access the blog in your browser.

You can then start creating your blog posts by adding Markdown files to the posts directory. Each Markdown file should include the necessary metadata (such as title, date, and author) at the beginning, followed by the content in Markdown format.
